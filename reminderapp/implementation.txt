How I set up this project:

First i downloaded git and installed it globally

1. created the virtual environment using conda
    - in the folder programming I created a virtual environment --> conda create -n certexpreminder

2. in the folder testapp I initialized git --> "git init"

3. activated the virtual environment in commandline --> conda activate certexpreminder

4. pip install django

5. django-admin startproject 'certificate reminder'

6. python manage.py startapp 'cert_app'

7. created urls.py in 'cert_app' folder -> created path for index view

8. updated urls.py in 'certificate_reminder' folder to point to 'cert_app/urls.py'

9. created 'index' view in 'cert_app/views.py'


At the end of every session:

1. update the requirements.txt by running: conda list -e > requirements.txt

2. update git:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message (what did you do this time)"
    - git push origin main
